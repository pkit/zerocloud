# Zerocloud request types

You can run ZeroVM jobs on ZeroCloud using different kinds of
requests. You run a job to process the data stored in ZeroCloud. This
could be a map-reduce job or it could be a simple filtering/processing
of the data before it's being served.

## POST

To issue POST request in Zerocloud you need to add
`X-Zerovm-Execute: 1.0` header to the request.

This is the most flexible method to start a ZeroVM job. Depending on
what `Content-Type` you pass there, the POST payload is interpreted
differently:

- `Content-Type: application/json` -
  [POST a job description](#post-a-job-description)

- `Content-Type: application/x-tar` or `Content-Type:
  application/x-gtar` or `Content-Type: application/x-ustar` -
  [POST a ZeroVM image](#post-a-zerovm-image-file)

- any other `Content-Type` - [POST a script](#post-any-other-file) to
  be handled by some interpreter or shell executable.

You can also add `X-Zerovm-Source` header to the POST request  
The header accepts the following format:  
`X-Zerovm-Source: <Swift Url>` (please see doc/Url.md on Swift Url format)  
If `X-Zerovm-Source` was supplied the job description file, 
image file or script file will be fetched from that url.
And POST request payload can be attached to any readable (`stdin`, `input` or 
`script`) channel instead.  
Notice: the object that `X-Zerovm-Source` points to should have a 
proper `Content-Type` set to get the behaviour described above.

### POST a job description

This POST will work only if url path info is of the form:
`/version/account` where `version` is the normal Swift version string
(not `open` or `open-with`).

If you issue POST with `Content-Type: application/json` and a
`X-Zerovm-Execute: 1.0` header, the POST data will be interpreted as a
JSON document. We call this a [job description](Servlets.md).

All objects that are mentioned in JSON file must already exist as
Swift objects (if they are readable) or be created by the job you're
trying to run (if writable).

This is the best use-case for preconfigured jobs where there are
little changes between the runs. It's best suited for clustered runs,
where you get a lot of nodes working on different objects and
communicating with each other.


### POST a ZeroVM image file

This POST will work only if url path info is of the form:
`/version/account`.

If you issue a POST with `Content-Type: any of the tar file types` and
a `X-Zerovm-Execute: 1.0` header, the POST data will be interpreted as
a ZeroVM image. A ZeroVM image is a tar file with several files and
directories inside. The tar file is used as the root filesystem of the
ZeroVM instance.

The minimal ZeroVM image contains just a `boot/system.map` file. This
file is a JSON job description file exactly the same as in a
[POST job description](#post-a-job-description) topic above.

Image can contain any number of files, all these files will be visible
to the running ZeroVM instance as its local root filesystem.
Essentially it's like "mounting" this tar file to `/`

This tar file can also contain the executable itself. If
`boot/system.map` has a relative path in `exec['path']` variable, the
executable will be extracted from the image file and only then ZeroVM
session will run.

You can always encapsulate all the data your executable needs in this
file: config files, executable, data files, libraries, etc.

`boot/system.map` can reference not only files inside the image but
also files outside by using absolute paths. You can also have
`boot/cluster.map` in the image. This JSON file will execute clustered
jobs.

The image file will be made available as a local filesystem on all the
nodes in the cluster. You can even reference different executables
from the same image file to run on different nodes.

### POST any other file

This POST will work if url path info is of the form:
`/version/account` or `/version/account/container/object`.

If you issue a POST with a `X-Zerovm-Execute: 1.0` header and any
other content type, the POST data will be interpreted as a script.

The script must contain a "shebang" line at the top (a line starting
with `#!`).

The shebang line can either include a full path to the executable, or
include a [system image file name](Configuration.md) and a relative
path to the executable inside the system image file.

- If you POST to `/version/account` the script will run on any
  available node and the result (stdout) will be sent back to you as
  `text/plain`.

- If you POST to `/version/account/container/object` the script will
  be run with the object file as input (stdin) and the result (stdout)
  will be sent back to you as `text/plain`.

Shebang examples:

    #! /my_container/bin/python
    #! system_python bin/python
    #! system_linux bin/sh

    system_python and system_linux are names of the system images

When your script is run, the filesystem will have it mounted as a
`/script` file (absolute path, directly in root dir).

The interpreter will have its home dir set to `/` and executed as
`/path/to/interpreter script` If you want to get stderr or mount any
other files into executable filesystem, you have to use other POST
formats (preferably: POST a ZeroVM image)

## GET

When you use a "dumb client" which cannot issue POST requests or set
special headers, you can use a GET request instead. To issue a GET
request in Zerocloud you need to specify a particular version string
in the Swift storage url.

As a reminder, the path in a Swift URL has the form

    /version/account/container/object

To trigger a ZeroVM job when retrieving the object, you need to
replace the `version` component with one of:

- `open` - will execute binary associated with `Content-Type` of the
  object you're GET-ting, akin to any file manager double-click
  function.

- `open-with` - not implemented yet

### GET with version `open`

When you issue a GET request with version `open`:
`/open/account/container/object`, the following events will fire:

- Zerocloud will get `Content-Type` of the object in url

- Zerocloud will search for object with path
  `/version/account/.zvm/content-type/config` in Swift

- if the object is found its contents will be used as a JSON job
  description template. This template **is cached for 60 seconds**.

- the template will be filled with details from GET request: object
  url and parts of query string

- the final JSON file will run and the result will be returned to user
  as a GET response

Example:

    GET /open/my_account/documents/my_doc.pdf -> Content-Type: application/x-pdf
    GET /v1/.zvm/application/x-pdf/config -> template


GET templates format is simple, it's a regular JSON file but with some
sort of substitution variables.

Each variable has format of `{.variable_name=default value}`. The
variables can occur at any place in the JSON file, they are
interpolated before the file is parsed.

If GET request has a query string all query params will be expanded as
a key->val dictionary and substituted instead of the matching template
variables. If there is no such variable in query string the default
value will be substituted. Example:

    template: {"args": "{.format=xml}"}
    if query string is: ?attr=val&format=pdf
    resulting JSON: {"args": "pdf"}
    if query string is: ?attr=val
    resulting JSON: {"args": "xml"}

The object path info `/container/object` will be substituted instead
of the reserved `{.object_path}` variable.

Issuing GET request for objects with `Content-Type:
application/x-nexe` will try to run these objects as ZeroVM
executables. STDOUT contents will be sent to the user in GET response.
If you supply the following query string params: `args`,
`content_type` they will be substituted for executable argument string
and response Content-Type respectively.

## Special headers

### Debug mode header

Request can use `X-Zerovm-Debug: true` header to enable user debug mode for 
the request. In that mode all the data from backends will be streamed back 
to the user in the response. The only data that will be saved to the 
location specified in job file, is the collocated channel data (you can 
disable that behavior by removing collocated channels using `"attach": "none"` 
node property, for each node).
